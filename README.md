# Weather App ðŸŒ¦

A sleek and responsive Weather App that provides real-time weather information for any city, using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Users can quickly access the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, complete with a dynamic weather icon that reflects the current state (e.g., cloudy, rainy, clear).
